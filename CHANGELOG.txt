0.1
----------------------------------------
Initial release

0.2 
----------------------------------------
Compiled against .NET 4.0
Now works with ASP.NET Website projects
Added KarbonText support
Added embed provider support

Breaking Changes:
ASP.NET Website projects don't support pre application start events
so Karbon request module is now registered in web.config. BootManagers
also now only have a .Initialize() method rather than .AppStarting() /
.AppStarted() methods.
