# Introduction
## What is Karbon CMS?
Karbon CMS is an Open Source, file based CMS written for ASP.NET MVC. It's main purpose is to provide developers a simple framework for creating CMS-driven websites / applications without the overhead of a full blown CMS.

Most developers are comfortable editing files, so an elaborate UI can add a lot of bloat to an application before you've even created your first page. Karbon CMS has no UI, so there is no bloat. Karbon CMS works based upon a few key conventions, most of which should feel comfortable to .NET developers. If you are just starting out though, don't worry as we've developed Karbon CMS with progressive enhancement in mind, so you should be able to get a simple site setup pretty quickly, but when you want a bit more control, Karbon CMS will give you the extension points you need without much fuss.

In Karbon CMS, we've tried to use as many standard practises as possible, so where we can make use of built in functionality, we do. We don't see the point in re-inventing the wheel. For anyone who has used jQuery, our API should look pretty familiar too, with all the traversal methods based heavily on the jQuery syntax.

Probably the biggest feature of Karbon CMS is the complete lack of database......
